Project Overview
The medical field faces significant challenges due to the overwhelming volume of imag- ing data and a shortage of radiologists, leading to increased workloads and diagnostic errors. Traditional radiology reporting systems often fail to produce detailed, compre- hensive reports, resulting in incomplete diagnoses and delays in treatment. To address these issues, RadXpert leverages advanced AI technologies such as BiomedCLIP, Med- SAM, R2GenGPT, and Google Gemini API to automate the generation of radiology re- ports. BiomedCLIP ensures accurate image-to-text alignment, while MedSAM provides interactive segmentation to highlight critical regions in medical images. R2GenGPT gen- erates coherent and contextually relevant reports, and the Google Gemini API enhances the clarity and detail of the final output. RadXpert offers a user-friendly dashboard that enables radiologists to upload images, receive automated, detailed reports, and focus on more complex cases, improving overall efficiency. By automating routine tasks, RadXpert significantly reduces the workload on radiologists, allowing them to concentrate on critical decision-making. The system’s abil- ity to generate precise, actionable reports leads to faster diagnoses and earlier interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. Developed using Agile methodologies, RadXpert has been tested on real-world datasets like IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrating its potential to streamline radiology work- flows. Future developments aim to expand RadXpert’s capabilities to support additional imaging modalities and ensure seamless integration with existing healthcare systems. By addressing the current gaps in radiology reporting and improving diagnostic accuracy, RadXpert represents a transformative solution in modern healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize radiology practices globally.
